                 DNS Filtering Details for Applications
             draft-nottingham-public-resolver-errors-latest

Abstract

   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-structured-dns-error] introduces structured error
   data for DNS responses that have been filtered.  This draft suggests
   additions to that mechanism that enable applications to convey the
   details of some filtering incidents to their users.

1.  Introduction

   Internet DNS resolvers are increasingly subject to legal orders that
   require blocking or filtering of specific names.  Because such
   filtering happens during DNS resolution, there is not an effective
   way to communicate what is happening to end users, often resulting in
   misattribution of the issue as a technical problem, rather than a
   policy intervention.

   This draft defines a mechanism to communicate such details when DNS
   resolver filtering of a name is legally mandated, based upon the
   structured error data for DNS responses introduced by
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-structured-dns-error].

   Allowing DNS resolvers to inject user-visible messages brings unique
   challenges.  Because DNS resolvers are often automatically configured
   by unknown networks and DNS responses are unauthenticated, these
   messages can come from untrusted parties -- including attackers
   (e.g., the so-called "coffee shop" attack) that leverage many users'
   lack of a nuanced model of the trust relationships between all of the
   parties that are involved in the service they are using.

   Furthermore, lowering the barrier to the presentation of messages
   explaining why access has been denied by the DNS resolver risks
   encouraging the wider deployment of DNS-based censorship on the
   Internet.

   This draft attempts to mitigate these risks by minimising the
   information carried in the DNS response to abstract, publicly
   registered identifiers -- the DNS Resolver Operator ID and the
   Filtering Incident ID.  A consuming party (e.g., a Web browser) can
   selectively present messages from those operators that they believe
   to be using this mechanism for its stated goal -- in particular,
   those who using it to surface policy-driven filtering, rather than
   enact discretionary censorship or attack end users.

1.1.  Example

   In typical use, a DNS query that is filtered might contain an
   Extended DNS Error Code 17 (see [RFC8914]) and an EXTRA-TEXT field
   containing:

   {
     "ro": "exampleResolver",
     "inc": "abc123"
   }

   This indicates that the "exampleResolver" resolver has generated the
   error, and the incident identifier is "abc123".

   An application that decides to present errors from "exampleResolver"
   to its users would look up "exampleResolver" in a local copy of the
   IANA DNS Resolver Identifier Registry (see Section 4.2) and obtain
   the corresponding template (see Section 3).  For purposes of this
   example, assume that the registry entry for that value contains:

   https://resolver.example.com/filtering-incidents/{inc}

   That template can be expanded using the value of "inc" to:

   https://resolver.example.com/filtering-incidents/abc123

   The application could (but might not) then decide to convey some or
   all of this information to its user; for example, with a statement
   that conveys:

      The webpage at www.example.net was blocked due to a legal request.
      Your DNS resolver may have more information about the legal
      request here:

      https://resolver.example.com/filtering-incidents/abc123

   Note that there is no requirement for the template to expand to a URL
   on any particular hostname; for example, it could be hosted by a
   party other than the resolver's server.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Data Types

   This section defines the data types used to look up the details of a
   filtering incident from a DNS error response.  Note that these
   identifiers are not for presentation to end users.

2.1.  DNS Resolver Operator ID

   A DNS Resolver Operator ID is a short, textual string that uniquely
   identifies the operator of a DNS resolver.  It is carried in the
   EXTRA-TEXT field of the Extended DNS Error with the JSON field name
   "ro".  For example:

   {
     "ro": "exampleResolver"
   }

   Generators MUST only use values that are registered in the DNS
   Resolver Operator registry; see Section 4.2.  Consumers MUST ignore
   unregistered values, and MAY ignore registered values.

2.2.  Filtering Incident ID

   A Filtering Incident ID is an opaque, string identifier for a
   particular filtering incident.  It might be specific to a particular
   request, but need not be.  It is carried in the EXTRA-TEXT field of
   the Extended DNS Error with the JSON field name "inc".  For example:

   {
     "inc": "abc123"
   }

3.  Incident Resolution Templates

   An Incident Resolution Template is a URI Template [RFC6570] contained
   in the DNS Resolver Identifier Registry (Section 4.2) that, upon
   expansion, provides a URI that can be dereferenced to obtain details
   about the filtering incident.

   It MUST be a Level 1 or Level 2 template (see Section 1.2 of
   [RFC6570]).  It has the following variables available to it:

   ro:  the DNS Resolver Operator ID (see Section 2.1)

   inc:  the Filtering Incident ID (see Section 2.2)

   For example:

   https://resolver.example.com/filtering-incidents/{inc}

   Applications MUST store a local copy of the DNS Resolver Identifier
   Registry for purposes of template lookup; they MUST NOT query the
   IANA registry upon each use.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  EXTRA-TEXT JSON Names

   IANA will register the following fields in the "EXTRA-TEXT JSON
   Names" sub-registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-structured-dns-error]:

   JSON Name:  "ro"
   Short Description:  a short, textual string that uniquely identifies
      the operator of a DNS resolver
   Mandatory:  no
   Specification:  this document

   JSON Name:  "inc"
   Short Description:  an opaque, string identifier for a particular
      filtering incident
   Mandatory:  no
   Specification:  this document

4.2.  The DNS Resolver Identifier Registry

   IANA will establish a new registry, the "DNS Resolver Identifier
   Registry."  Its registration policy is first-come, first-served
   (FCFS), although IANA may refuse registrations that it deems to be
   deceptive or spurious.

   It contains the following fields:

   Name:  The name of the DNS resolver operator

   Contact:  an e-mail address or other appropriate contact mechanism

   DNS Resolver Operator ID:  see Section 2.1

   Incident Resolution Template:  see Section 3

   The Incident Resolution Template can be updated by the contact at any
   time.  However, operators SHOULD accommodate potentially long lag
   times for applications to update their copies of the registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not provide a way to authenticate that a
   particular filtering incident as experienced by an application was
   actually associated with the information presented.  This means that
   an attacker (for example, one controlling a DNS resolver) can claim
   that a particular filtering incident is occurring when in fact it is
   not.  However, a successful attack would need to reuse an existing
   DNS Resolver Operator ID and Filtering Incident ID that combine to
   expand to a URL that can be successfully dereferenced.  Doing so is
   not currently thought to be particularly advantageous to an attacker
   to do so.  Future iterations of this specification may introduce more
   robust protections.

   The details of DNS responses are not available to all applications,
   depending on how they are architected and the information made
   available to them by their host.  As a result, this mechanism is not
   reliable; some applications will not be able to display this error
   information.

   Because the registry is first-come, first-served, Applications (such
   as Web browsers) will need to exercise judgement regarding which
   operators' error messages they display to users.  This decision might
   be influenced by the identity of the resolver (e.g., so-called
   "public resolvers" are likely to use this mechanism responsibly), its
   history (e.g., a well-known Internet Service Provider that has been
   subject to legal filtering orders), or local configuration (e.g.,
   application or operating system settings that indicate that a
   particular resolver is to be trusted).
